Governance: Resolv Labs currently oversees USR minting and redemption parameters through an administrative multisig. Though the protocol plans to transition to a $RESOLV governance token, whitelisted addresses still hold exclusive permission to mint or redeem. Users must rely on Resolv’s operational integrity and roadmap commitments until permissionless minting is fully realized.\\n2. Security: Audits of USR, RLP, staking contracts (including wstUSR), and related Request Manager logic were conducted by reputable firms such as MixBytes, Pessimistic, and Pashov. No critical vulnerabilities remain unresolved. However, partial reliance on off-exchange custody (Fireblocks, Ceffu) for hedging entails some exposure to exchange or custodian compromise. A bug bounty program (expected post-$RESOLV launch) will provide a secondary security layer.\\n3. Regulatory Risks: USR’s design mixes crypto-collateralization (ETH, stETH) and T-Bill–backed assets (via MakerDAO’s USDS). Future regulatory actions against stablecoins, tokenized securities (RWA), or off-exchange custodians could disrupt Resolv’s mint/redeem flows. Regional compliance changes or centralized exchange constraints might also hamper the delta-neutral hedging strategy.\\n4. Collateral & Liquidity: Because USR is hedged against ETH price movements, its peg remains stable so long as derivatives markets remain liquid. Large-scale USR redemptions still rely on whitelisted participants, but secondary liquidity pools (Uniswap, Curve, Aerodrome) and an on-chain bridging mechanism (LayerZero’s Stargate) help maintain healthy liquidity.\\n5. Competitive Edge: Unlike purely crypto-backed stablecoins, USR incorporates T-Bill yields via partial MakerDAO integration while leveraging a delta-neutral approach. This structure appeals to users seeking a stable, yield-enriched asset with robust risk mitigations.\\n6. Oracle & Price Feeds: FiRM will implement a pessimistic LP token oracle for accurate valuation of the DOLA/USR LP. This process uses Chainlink price feeds for USR and the virtual price from the Curve pool’s smart contract and ensures a conservative and reliable estimate of the LP token\'s USD value. Real-time monitoring will further support price accuracy and integrity.\\n7. Liquidation Mechanisms: The liquidation factor and incentive are optimized to encourage active liquidator participation. Arbitrage opportunities with other DOLA or USR LPs will ensure that large liquidations do not lead to a liquidation cascade. The liquidation process will pull vault tokens, convert them to LP tokens, and then allow liquidators to realize value through balanced withdrawals, ensuring efficient liquidation routes.\\n\\nContinuous monitoring of the DOLA/USR LP’s performance, yields, and liquidity conditions will be maintained by the RWG.

to add PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 Market to FiRM","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/proposal-to-add-pt-susde-29may2025-market-to-firm/544\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to integrate the PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 token from Pendle as a collateral asset on FiRM, Inverse Finance’s fixed-rate lending protocol. Like its predecessor (the successfully onboarded PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025), PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 is a Principal Token representing the right to receive 1 USDe upon maturity—this time on May 28, 2025. While the risk assumptions remain the same as the earlier market, the key distinctions are:\\n\\n1. A switch to Pendle’s audited Discount to NAV Oracle to price PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 based on a fixed discount rate of 20% (rather than the fixed $1 approach).\\n2. A change in the Collateral Factor (CF) to 91.5%.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nPendle Finance is a yield-trading platform that tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two components:\\n\\n1. Principal Tokens (PTs), redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity;\\n2. Yield Tokens (YTs), which accrue the asset’s yield until expiry.\\n\\nAfter a successful integration of PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 on FiRM in late 2024, demand for PT-based strategies has proven to be strong. This new PT, PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, extends the maturity date and aims to offer continued opportunities for fixed-income and carry-trade strategies, leveraging FiRM’s fixed-rate borrowing.\\n\\n### Discount to NAV Oracle\\n\\nWhen FiRM onboarded PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025, to simplify risk management and minimize potential manipulation, we opted for a fixed $1 oracle along with a policy-multisig–controlled fallback to respond to extreme conditions or potential oracle malfunctions. While this was prudent for the initial launch, it was an imperfect solution as the fixed $1 price feed did not account for market discounts or yield to maturity over time.\\n\\nFor PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, we propose using the Discount to NAV Oracle originally deployed by Pendle, audited by WatchPug and currently in use for Morpho’s PT markets. The feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears. Only two main parameters—discount rate and time (block #) of maturity—must be configured. Importantly, by setting a conservative discount rate, the protocol intentionally underprices the PT relative to potential market optimism, which is safer from a protocol risk perspective.\\n\\nBased on yield data for sUSDe PT markets, present time to maturity, and referencing methodologies used by other protocols (e.g., Morpho, Aave, and Spark in the Sky forum) — the RWG recommends a 20% discount rate for PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025. This is informed by\\n\\n1. Historical Pendle PT Yields: sUSDe PT yields have frequently hovered in the 15–25% APY range, with occasional spikes higher.\\n2. Comparable PT Deployments: The 20% discount rate has been used on other platforms successfully (e.g., Morpho’s PT-USDe-Feb2025) to balance between over- and under-estimating collateral value.\\n3. Market Growth Expectation: While PT yields can spike briefly, sustained extreme yield environments (>70% APY) remain unlikely with the growth of USDe.\\n\\n### Oracle Switch Guardian Role\\n\\nFor the PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 integration, governance [approved the use of an oracle switch guardian](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/227), assigning it to the Policy multisig. RWG recommends we retain a guardian fallback for the PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 market to address significant deviations from expected yields or catastrophic scenarios (e.g., a USDe depeg) by swapping the discount to NAV fixed feed to a discount to NAV USDe feed that has sUSDe’s peg factored in.\\n\\nFor a more detailed overview of how the Feed Switch with guardian operates as well as the design choices that went into deciding our choice of PT oracle for FiRM, refer to the [risk assessment prepared by the RWG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHg3M8QORWmDPmueoIrUx88ySoARtvQeJz0mvdCQUjI/edit?usp=sharing).\\n\\n### Collateral Factor Setting\\n\\nCollateral Factor (CF) in FiRM determines the maximum DOLA a user can borrow against the discounted value of their PT. For the PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 market, the CF was set at 87%, balancing capital efficiency with the risk of PT discounts due to spikes in implied yield.\\n\\nWith PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, we propose raising the CF to 91.5%, matching other PT markets on other lending protocols. The switch to a feed that will underprice the collateral, compared to our previous choice that overpriced it, justifies the increase in CF from 87%. Furthermore, our prior analysis (with PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 at 87% CF and a fixed $1 oracle) showed that higher CFs could be acceptable if the feed accounts for implied yields. This combination (20% discount rate + 91.5% CF) offers capital efficiency while providing adequate protection in typical yield spikes (e.g., 40–50% APY).\\n\\n### Risk Assessment\\n\\nBecause PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 is structurally identical to PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025—just with a different expiry date—the same risk assumptions apply. These were covered in a past [risk assessment document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15fpdoJSHqZQGnHy_-85_VaC70Mbeu7o9k2YqRfrQQys/edit?usp=sharing) produced by the RWG.\\n\\n### On-Chain Actions\\n\\n1.

This new PT, PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, extends the maturity date and aims to offer continued opportunities for fixed-income and carry-trade strategies, leveraging FiRM’s fixed-rate borrowing.\\n\\nDiscount to NAV Oracle\\n\\nWhen FiRM onboarded PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025, to simplify risk management and minimize potential manipulation, we opted for a fixed $1 oracle along with a policy-multisig–controlled fallback to respond to extreme conditions or potential oracle malfunctions. While this was prudent for the initial launch, it was an imperfect solution as the fixed $1 price feed did not account for market discounts or yield to maturity over time.\\n\\nFor PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, we propose using the Discount to NAV Oracle originally deployed by Pendle, audited by WatchPug and currently in use for Morpho’s PT markets. The feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears. Only two main parameters—discount rate and time (block #) of maturity—must be configured. Importantly, by setting a conservative discount rate, the protocol intentionally underprices the PT relative to potential market optimism, which is safer from a protocol risk perspective.\\n\\nBased on yield data for sUSDe PT markets, present time to maturity, and referencing methodologies used by other protocols (e.g., Morpho, Aave, and Spark in the Sky forum) — the RWG recommends a 20% discount rate for PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025. This is informed by\\n\\nHistorical Pendle PT Yields: sUSDe PT yields have frequently hovered in the 15–25% APY range, with occasional spikes higher.\\nComparable PT Deployments: The 20% discount rate has been used on other platforms successfully (e.g., Morpho’s PT-USDe-Feb2025) to balance between over- and under-estimating collateral value.\\nMarket Growth Expectation: While PT yields can spike briefly, sustained extreme yield environments (>70% APY) remain unlikely with the growth of USDe.\\n\\nOracle Switch Guardian Role\\n\\nFor the PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 integration, governance approved the use of an oracle switch guardian, assigning it to the Policy multisig. RWG recommends we retain a guardian fallback for the PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 market to address significant deviations from expected yields or catastrophic scenarios (e.g., a USDe depeg) by swapping the discount to NAV fixed feed to a discount to NAV USDe feed that has sUSDe’s peg factored in.\\n\\nFor a more detailed overview of how the Feed Switch with guardian operates as well as the design choices that went into deciding our choice of PT oracle for FiRM, refer to the risk assessment prepared by the RWG.\\n\\nCollateral Factor Setting\\n\\nCollateral Factor (CF) in FiRM determines the maximum DOLA a user can borrow against the discounted value of their PT. For the PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 market, the CF was set at 87%, balancing capital efficiency with the risk of PT discounts due to spikes in implied yield.\\n\\nWith PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025, we propose raising the CF to 91.5%, matching other PT markets on other lending protocols. The switch to a feed that will underprice the collateral, compared to our previous choice that overpriced it, justifies the increase in CF from 87%. Furthermore, our prior analysis (with PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 at 87% CF and a fixed $1 oracle) showed that higher CFs could be acceptable if the feed accounts for implied yields. This combination (20% discount rate + 91.5% CF) offers capital efficiency while providing adequate protection in typical yield spikes (e.g., 40–50% APY).\\n\\nRisk Assessment\\n\\nBecause PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 is structurally identical to PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025—just with a different expiry date—the same risk assumptions apply. These were covered in a past risk assessment document produced by the RWG.\\n\\nOn-Chain Actions\\n\\nAdd PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 Market to the DBR contract\\nSet borrowController of this market to the FiRM BorrowController\\nSet market supply ceiling to 20,000,000 DOLA\\nSet daily limit in BorrowController to 2,000,000 DOLA\\nSet Collateral Factor to 91.5%\\nSet Liquidation Factor to 100%\\nSet Liquidation Incentive to 5%\\nApprove PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 market on the DBR Helper\\nSet Minimum Debt Amount in BorrowController to 3,000 DOLA\\nSet stalenessThreshold for the PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 market to 86,460 seconds\\nSet FiRM Oracle price feed for PT-sUSDe-29MAY2025 to the deployed FeedSwitch\\n","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0xad038eb671c44b853887a7e32528fab35dc5d710","signature":"addMarket(address)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","signature":"setBorrowController(address)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002dbad53a647a86b8988e007a33fe78bd55e9dd6f","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000108b2a2c28029094000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2dbad53a647a86b8988e007a33fe78bd55e9dd6f","signature":"setDailyLimit(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd900000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a784379d99db42000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","signature":"setCollateralFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000023be","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","signature":"setLiquidationFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002710","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","signature":"setLiquidationIncentiveBps(uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001f4","value":"0"},{"target":"0xec51e66c1e1bfc85acc3b6847820a3ff0a38364b","signature":"approveMarket(address)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd9","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2dbad53a647a86b8988e007a33fe78bd55e9dd6f","signature":"setMinDebt(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a2a15d09519be00000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2dbad53a647a86b8988e007a33fe78bd55e9dd6f","signature":"setStalenessThreshold(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002d4788893de7a4fb42106d9db36b65463428fbd900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000151bc","value":"0"},{"target":"0xabe146cf570fd27ddd985895ce9b138a7110cce8","signature":"setFeed(address,address,uint8)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000b7de5dfcb74d25c2f21841fbd6230355c50d9308000000000000000000000000dd6c517eec89043126974969565819dcb098a7600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x58a15c1b4821a5bc2529c3b93538daea9ca8e7f4","support":true,"votes":3130.874325433653},{"id":2,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":21831.78144144629}]},{"id":277,"proposalNum":306,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x2723723fdd3db8ba2d6f0e1b333e90a7e60a0411","etaTimestamp":1742819399000,"startTimestamp":1742438039000,"endTimestamp":1742646435976,"startBlock":22085119,"endBlock":22102399,"forVotes":25140.701964444153,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1742819663000,"title":"Sunset the FRAX LP and cvxFXS Markets","description":"Forum: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/sunset-the-fraxbp-and-fraxpyusd-lp-markets/552\\n\\n# Sunset the FRAX LP and cvxFXS Markets\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal aims to formally retire the FraxBP and FraxPyUSD LP FiRM markets (listed below) by pausing borrows and setting each market’s market ceiling parameter to 0.

The new model separates core pricing functions into distinct, independently verified components, which are then composed to derive final price calculations.\\n\\nInstead of embedding all calculations within a single contract, ChainlinkBridgeAssetFeed aggregates pricing data from two Chainlink feeds—one for a collateral/bridge-asset pair and another for the bridge-asset/USD rate—ensuring clear separation of concerns and easier verification. A boolean flag (bridgeAssetDenominator) allows the contract to handle cases where the denominator in the collateral-bridge pair varies, and thus ensures proper configuration regardless of price feed structure.\\n\\nBy migrating the wBTC market feed to this model, future deployments become faster, verification is streamlined, and protocol reliability improves. This update also introduces a fallback price source for ETH/USD, increasing resilience for the wETH market against temporary oracle failures.\\n\\nImplementation\\n\\nE.g.

These restrictions will reject extreme or suspicious values automatically, reducing the probability of human error affecting live markets.\\n\\nResolution Plan: Feed Fix and Return of Funds\\n\\nSince 100% of the at-risk funds were successfully secured through whitehat efforts, all three impacted users can be fully restored to their pre-incident state once the feed is corrected.\\n\\nThe following actions will resolve the issue:\\n\\nCorrect the WBTC feed on FiRM by updating tokenDecimals to 8.\\nReturn WBTC to the affected users’ FiRM PCE addresses:\\n  Return 0.97806938 WBTC to 0x5e5d086781Ec430E56bd4410b0Af106B86292339\\n  Return 3.59144374 WBTC to 0x52555b437EeE8F55a7897B4E1F8fB3e7Edb2b344\\n  Return 1.11234807 WBTC to 0xE58ED128325A33afD08e90187dB0640619819413\\n\\nThese steps will fully restore user balances and ensure the WBTC market is functioning correctly.\\n\\nUI Sim screenshot of the above actions executed:\\n|2048x814","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0xabe146cf570fd27ddd985895ce9b138a7110cce8","signature":"setFeed(address,address,uint8)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599000000000000000000000000a0c624a99ec87a8010f65f277787f697346196e60000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599","signature":"approve(address,uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000048ba574edf0bc4e2e40b529863aaa6a67c264e7c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021ddd507","value":"0"},{"target":"0x48ba574edf0bc4e2e40b529863aaa6a67c264e7c","signature":"deposit(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000005e5d086781ec430e56bd4410b0af106b862923390000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005d46a5a","value":"0"},{"target":"0x48ba574edf0bc4e2e40b529863aaa6a67c264e7c","signature":"deposit(address,uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000052555b437eee8f55a7897b4e1f8fb3e7edb2b3440000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015681bb6","value":"0"},{"target":"0x48ba574edf0bc4e2e40b529863aaa6a67c264e7c","signature":"deposit(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000e58ed128325a33afd08e90187db06406198194130000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006a14ef7","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":22484.856756880392},{"id":2,"voter":"0x9afe6d08d08e53a4bb0d0deb306a7f9f7191d0ae","support":true,"votes":1652.1050396545704},{"id":3,"voter":"0xe58ed128325a33afd08e90187db0640619819413","support":true,"votes":7284.234412907591}]},{"id":282,"proposalNum":311,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x2723723fdd3db8ba2d6f0e1b333e90a7e60a0411","etaTimestamp":1743911951000,"startTimestamp":1743530567000,"endTimestamp":1743737404547,"startBlock":22175723,"endBlock":22193003,"forVotes":104728.52611943166,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1743912155000,"title":"Increase Market Supply Ceiling for DOLA/USR LP Markets on FiRM","description":"Forum: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/increase-market-supply-ceilings-for-dola-usr-lp-markets-on-firm/557\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to increase the market supply ceiling parameters for both the Yearn-aligned and Convex-aligned DOLA/USR Liquidity Pool Token (LPT) markets on FiRM, Inverse Finance’s fixed-rate lending protocol, from the current 10,000,000 DOLA to 20,000,000 DOLA each.

Update to Pectra-Compliant FiRM Borrow Controller","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/update-to-pectra-compliant-firm-borrow-controller/547\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to update the FiRM Borrow Controller across all active markets to a newly-deployed, Pectra-compliant version, addressing security risks introduced by [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md#self-sponsoring-allowing-txorigin-to-set-code). The upgrade ensures continued protection against flash loan exploits, reentrancy, and atomic transaction manipulations, while maintaining all previously implemented risk controls such as the rolling 24-hour borrow limit and daily borrow caps.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nThe borrow controller in FiRM plays a crucial role in risk management, ensuring that borrowing transactions comply with security measures such as:\\n\\n* **Minimum Debt Amount**: Protecting the protocol from griefing by enforcing a minimum market debt allowed to be carried per user.\\n* **Smart Contract Verification**: Restricting borrowing from unauthorized smart contracts to mitigate risk.\\n* **Rolling 24-Hour Borrow Limit**: Preventing exploitative behaviors related to fixed-time resets.\\n* **Staleness Threshold**:  Addressing stale oracle data exploits by preventing borrowing when price feeds have not updated within a governance-defined timeframe.\\n\\nHowever, with the first phase of the Pectra hard fork scheduled for mid-March 2025, [Ethereum\'s EIP-7702](https://mixbytes.io/blog/the-prague-electra-pectra-hardfork-explained) introduces the ability for EOAs (externally owned accounts) to delegate execution to smart contracts, effectively bypassing FiRM’s existing protections against flash loans and reentrancy attacks.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks, the new borrow controller enforces a stricter validation, combining `tx.origin == msg.sender` with `msg.sender.code.length == 0` to ensure that the caller is not a delegated smart contract. In doing so, it ensures full compatibility with the Pectra hard fork, maintaining security without sacrificing user experience.\\n\\nThe new borrow controller has been rigorously tested on the Prague EVM and reviewed by 3rd parties, both of which confirm it correctly blocks unauthorized delegated transactions while maintaining expected protocol functionality.\\n\\n### Implementation Plan\\n\\nThis proposal will standardize the borrow controller across all active markets, eliminating existing discrepancies and bringing the rolling 24-hour borrow limit to all markets. All previously whitelisted addresses as well as market-specific daily borrow limits, staleness thresholds, and min debts will need to be set. As such with 33 live markets, this will require over 100 on-chain actions.

Update to Pectra-Compliant FiRM Borrow Controller","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/update-to-pectra-compliant-firm-borrow-controller/547\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to update the FiRM Borrow Controller across all active markets to a newly-deployed, Pectra-compliant version, addressing security risks introduced by [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md#self-sponsoring-allowing-txorigin-to-set-code). The upgrade ensures continued protection against flash loan exploits, reentrancy, and atomic transaction manipulations, while maintaining all previously implemented risk controls such as the rolling 24-hour borrow limit and daily borrow caps.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nThe borrow controller in FiRM plays a crucial role in risk management, ensuring that borrowing transactions comply with security measures such as:\\n\\n* **Minimum Debt Amount**: Protecting the protocol from griefing by enforcing a minimum market debt allowed to be carried per user.\\n* **Smart Contract Verification**: Restricting borrowing from unauthorized smart contracts to mitigate risk.\\n* **Rolling 24-Hour Borrow Limit**: Preventing exploitative behaviors related to fixed-time resets.\\n* **Staleness Threshold**:  Addressing stale oracle data exploits by preventing borrowing when price feeds have not updated within a governance-defined timeframe.\\n\\nHowever, with the first phase of the Pectra hard fork scheduled for mid-March 2025, [Ethereum\'s EIP-7702](https://mixbytes.io/blog/the-prague-electra-pectra-hardfork-explained) introduces the ability for EOAs (externally owned accounts) to delegate execution to smart contracts, effectively bypassing FiRM’s existing protections against flash loans and reentrancy attacks.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks, the new borrow controller enforces a stricter validation, combining `tx.origin == msg.sender` with `msg.sender.code.length == 0` to ensure that the caller is not a delegated smart contract. In doing so, it ensures full compatibility with the Pectra hard fork, maintaining security without sacrificing user experience.\\n\\nThe new borrow controller has been rigorously tested on the Prague EVM and reviewed by 3rd parties, both of which confirm it correctly blocks unauthorized delegated transactions while maintaining expected protocol functionality.\\n\\n### Implementation Plan\\n\\nThis proposal will standardize the borrow controller across all active markets, eliminating existing discrepancies and bringing the rolling 24-hour borrow limit to all markets. All previously whitelisted addresses as well as market-specific daily borrow limits, staleness thresholds, and min debts will need to be set. As such with 33 live markets, this will require over 100 on-chain actions.

Update to Pectra-Compliant FiRM Borrow Controller","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/update-to-pectra-compliant-firm-borrow-controller/547\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to update the FiRM Borrow Controller across all active markets to a newly-deployed, Pectra-compliant version, addressing security risks introduced by [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md#self-sponsoring-allowing-txorigin-to-set-code). The upgrade ensures continued protection against flash loan exploits, reentrancy, and atomic transaction manipulations, while maintaining all previously implemented risk controls such as the rolling 24-hour borrow limit and daily borrow caps.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nThe borrow controller in FiRM plays a crucial role in risk management, ensuring that borrowing transactions comply with security measures such as:\\n\\n* **Minimum Debt Amount**: Protecting the protocol from griefing by enforcing a minimum market debt allowed to be carried per user.\\n* **Smart Contract Verification**: Restricting borrowing from unauthorized smart contracts to mitigate risk.\\n* **Rolling 24-Hour Borrow Limit**: Preventing exploitative behaviors related to fixed-time resets.\\n* **Staleness Threshold**:  Addressing stale oracle data exploits by preventing borrowing when price feeds have not updated within a governance-defined timeframe.\\n\\nHowever, with the first phase of the Pectra hard fork scheduled for mid-March 2025, [Ethereum\'s EIP-7702](https://mixbytes.io/blog/the-prague-electra-pectra-hardfork-explained) introduces the ability for EOAs (externally owned accounts) to delegate execution to smart contracts, effectively bypassing FiRM’s existing protections against flash loans and reentrancy attacks.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks, the new borrow controller enforces a stricter validation, combining `tx.origin == msg.sender` with `msg.sender.code.length == 0` to ensure that the caller is not a delegated smart contract. In doing so, it ensures full compatibility with the Pectra hard fork, maintaining security without sacrificing user experience.\\n\\nThe new borrow controller has been rigorously tested on the Prague EVM and reviewed by 3rd parties, both of which confirm it correctly blocks unauthorized delegated transactions while maintaining expected protocol functionality.\\n\\n### Implementation Plan\\n\\nThis proposal will standardize the borrow controller across all active markets, eliminating existing discrepancies and bringing the rolling 24-hour borrow limit to all markets. All previously whitelisted addresses as well as market-specific daily borrow limits, staleness thresholds, and min debts will need to be set. As such with 33 live markets, this will require over 100 on-chain actions.

Update to Pectra-Compliant FiRM Borrow Controller","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/update-to-pectra-compliant-firm-borrow-controller/547\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to update the FiRM Borrow Controller across all active markets to a newly-deployed, Pectra-compliant version, addressing security risks introduced by [EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md#self-sponsoring-allowing-txorigin-to-set-code). The upgrade ensures continued protection against flash loan exploits, reentrancy, and atomic transaction manipulations, while maintaining all previously implemented risk controls such as the rolling 24-hour borrow limit and daily borrow caps.\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nThe borrow controller in FiRM plays a crucial role in risk management, ensuring that borrowing transactions comply with security measures such as:\\n\\n* **Minimum Debt Amount**: Protecting the protocol from griefing by enforcing a minimum market debt allowed to be carried per user.\\n* **Smart Contract Verification**: Restricting borrowing from unauthorized smart contracts to mitigate risk.\\n* **Rolling 24-Hour Borrow Limit**: Preventing exploitative behaviors related to fixed-time resets.\\n* **Staleness Threshold**:  Addressing stale oracle data exploits by preventing borrowing when price feeds have not updated within a governance-defined timeframe.\\n\\nHowever, with the first phase of the Pectra hard fork scheduled for mid-March 2025, [Ethereum\'s EIP-7702](https://mixbytes.io/blog/the-prague-electra-pectra-hardfork-explained) introduces the ability for EOAs (externally owned accounts) to delegate execution to smart contracts, effectively bypassing FiRM’s existing protections against flash loans and reentrancy attacks.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks, the new borrow controller enforces a stricter validation, combining `tx.origin == msg.sender` with `msg.sender.code.length == 0` to ensure that the caller is not a delegated smart contract. In doing so, it ensures full compatibility with the Pectra hard fork, maintaining security without sacrificing user experience.\\n\\nThe new borrow controller has been rigorously tested on the Prague EVM and reviewed by 3rd parties, both of which confirm it correctly blocks unauthorized delegated transactions while maintaining expected protocol functionality.\\n\\n### Implementation Plan\\n\\nThis proposal will standardize the borrow controller across all active markets, eliminating existing discrepancies and bringing the rolling 24-hour borrow limit to all markets. All previously whitelisted addresses as well as market-specific daily borrow limits, staleness thresholds, and min debts will need to be set.

Deploy ALE V3 with Aggregator Support","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/deploy-ale-v2-with-aggregator-support/559\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to deploy ALE V2 to replace and enhance the existing ALE on FiRM. ALE V2 consolidates our leverage logic into a single, robust contract, supporting both 1inch and Odos aggregators for more efficient and flexible routing. In addition, ALE V2 integrates Pendle PT collateral functionality, simplifying complex leverage actions and enabling users to easily leverage into- and deleverage from yield strategies with PT and YT tokens.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nThe original ALE was designed to facilitate looping and leveraging for FiRM markets but had limitations in flexibility and required repeated redeployments for new collateral types. Additionally, previous helper contracts required fragmented logic for handling different collateral compositions, resulting in technical debt and deployment friction.\\n\\nALE V2 represents a major architectural improvement, merging the previous ALE and undeployed ALEPendle implementations into one contract and updating all associated helpers to a unified interface. The engine now directly supports:\\n\\n* Pendle PT markets, with helper-based mint/redeem handling for PT and YT tokens.\\n* Aggregator-based swaps via both 1inch and Odos, allowing for more optimal execution routes and future scalability.\\n* Cleaner interfaces for dynamic helpers (CurveDolaLPHelper, ERC4626Helper, and YVYCRVHelper), reducing complexity and the risk of errors.\\n\\nThis upgrade significantly reduces maintenance overhead by enabling quicker deployment of new markets and collateral types without repeated code rewrites.

replace and enhance the existing ALE on FiRM. ALE V2 consolidates our leverage logic into a single, robust contract, supporting both 1inch and Odos aggregators for more efficient and flexible routing. In addition, ALE V2 integrates Pendle PT collateral functionality, simplifying complex leverage actions and enabling users to easily leverage into- and deleverage from yield strategies with PT and YT tokens.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nThe original ALE was designed to facilitate looping and leveraging for FiRM markets but had limitations in flexibility and required repeated redeployments for new collateral types. Additionally, previous helper contracts required fragmented logic for handling different collateral compositions, resulting in technical debt and deployment friction.\\n\\nALE V2 represents a major architectural improvement, merging the previous ALE and undeployed ALEPendle implementations into one contract and updating all associated helpers to a unified interface. The engine now directly supports:\\n\\n* Pendle PT markets, with helper-based mint/redeem handling for PT and YT tokens.\\n* Aggregator-based swaps via both 1inch and Odos, allowing for more optimal execution routes and future scalability.\\n* Cleaner interfaces for dynamic helpers (CurveDolaLPHelper, ERC4626Helper, and YVYCRVHelper), reducing complexity and the risk of errors.\\n\\nThis upgrade significantly reduces maintenance overhead by enabling quicker deployment of new markets and collateral types without repeated code rewrites.

Deploy ALE V3 with Aggregator Support","description":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/deploy-ale-v2-with-aggregator-support/559\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal seeks to deploy ALE V2 to replace and enhance the existing ALE on FiRM. ALE V2 consolidates our leverage logic into a single, robust contract, supporting both 1inch and Odos aggregators for more efficient and flexible routing. In addition, ALE V2 integrates Pendle PT collateral functionality, simplifying complex leverage actions and enabling users to easily leverage into- and deleverage from yield strategies with PT and YT tokens.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nThe original ALE was designed to facilitate looping and leveraging for FiRM markets but had limitations in flexibility and required repeated redeployments for new collateral types.

Summary\\n\\nThis proposal recommends formally sunsetting seven inactive, redundant, or expired FiRM markets by setting their market ceilings to the minimum viable amounts and pausing new borrows where needed. The markets targeted for deprecation include: DAI, FRAX, COMP, yv-DOLA/crvUSD LP, DOLA/crvUSD LP, PT-sUSDe-29MAY25, and PT-sUSDe-27MAR25. These actions are part of a broader operational cleanup initiative to streamline FiRM’s collateral roster, reduce unnecessary risk exposure, and improve protocol efficiency.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nAs FiRM matures, periodic reviews of its supported collateral markets are essential to maintaining a healthy, efficient lending protocol. Several of FiRM’s earliest markets were launched during periods of experimentation or opportunistic integration and have since seen their relevance diminish. In some cases, the underlying assets have been deprecated or superseded by newer mechanisms; in others, anticipated ecosystem partnerships failed to materialize.\\n\\nSunsetting unused or low-utility markets serves multiple objectives. It removes operational overhead from the RWG, reduces the monitoring burden for oracles and liquidity, and minimizes governance surface area around parameters that no longer require tuning. From a security perspective, deprecating dormant markets also narrows the protocol’s exposure to tail risks, such as flash liquidity drains, mispriced feeds, or liquidations in low-liquidity and/or high-gas environments.\\n\\nBy formally winding down these markets, we reinforce our commitment to good protocol hygiene and signal to external partners and users that FiRM collateral is thoughtfully curated and regularly maintained.\\n\\n### Background & Rationale\\n\\n**DAI**\\nThe DAI FiRM market was originally introduced to support users leveraging the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) for fixed-rate borrowing. However, since MakerDAO’s rebrand to Sky and strategic pivot toward its new USDS stablecoin, DAI’s incentive structure is steadily eroding. Given that the DOLA/sUSDS LP is already supported as collateral, the DAI market is now redundant and unnecessary to maintain.\\n\\n**sFRAX**\\nFrax Finance has officially “upgraded” the FRAX stablecoin to frxUSD, its new flagship asset for algorithmic stability and RWA integration. While 1:1 swapping between the two will be available for some time, liquidity, incentivization, and management for the old FRAX contract will inevitably trend to 0.\\n\\n**COMP**\\nThe COMP market was initially launched with the potential for strategic alignment with the Compound ecosystem. However, those plans never advanced into actionable integrations, and market activity has remained near-zero for most of its lifecycle. Compounding the issue, on-chain liquidity for COMP has thinned considerably, making it a less reliable asset for collateralized borrowing. Continuing to monitor and support this market offers little upside and introduces maintenance risk, making deprecation the prudent choice.\\n\\n**DOLA/crvUSD LP** & **yv-DOLA/crvUSD LP**\\nThe base DOLA/crvUSD LP markets have become functionally obsolete following the TWG’s decision to shift incentives toward DOLA pools on Curve paired with yield-bearing stablecoins. The sDOLA/crvUSD and sDOLA/scrvUSD LPs now represent the preferred markets. Sunsetting this market removes redundancy and supports the consolidation of DOLA liquidity around more strategic pool compositions.\\n\\n**PT-sUSDe-29MAY25 & PT-sUSDe-27MAR25**\\nWith both markets now expired, and the March 2025 market already paused, they no longer serve any purpose as active collateral.

This represents a clear demand driver to scale FiRM\'s debt and revenue to new highs.\\n\\nRisk Assessment and Parameter Recommendation\\n\\nPlease see the Risk Assessment carried out by the RWG for PT-sUSDe-31JUL25 Collateral on FiRM here.\\n\\nWith the following parameter recommendation:\\n|Parameter|Recommended Value|\\n| --- | --- |\\n|Supply Ceiling|50,000,000 DOLA|\\n|Daily Borrow Limit|5,000,000 DOLA|\\n|Collateral Factor|91.5%|\\n|Liquidation Factor|100%|\\n|Liquidation Incentive|5%|\\n|Minimum Debt Amount|3,000 DOLA|\\n|Oracle|Discount to NAV, r = 20%|\\n\\nThese parameters are accepted and will be pushed forward in this proposal.","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0xad038eb671c44b853887a7e32528fab35dc5d710","signature":"addMarket(address)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","value":"0"},{"target":"0xf85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","signature":"setBorrowController(address)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000eebea1ed06eeb120cbf72fad195683746b5a5245","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000295be96e64066972000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0xeebea1ed06eeb120cbf72fad195683746b5a5245","signature":"setDailyLimit(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000422ca8b0a00a425000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0xf85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","signature":"setLiquidationFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002710","value":"0"},{"target":"0xf85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","signature":"setLiquidationIncentiveBps(uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001f4","value":"0"},{"target":"0xf85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","signature":"setCollateralFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000023be","value":"0"},{"target":"0xec51e66c1e1bfc85acc3b6847820a3ff0a38364b","signature":"approveMarket(address)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","value":"0"},{"target":"0xeebea1ed06eeb120cbf72fad195683746b5a5245","signature":"setStalenessThreshold(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000151bc","value":"0"},{"target":"0xeebea1ed06eeb120cbf72fad195683746b5a5245","signature":"setMinDebt(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a2a15d09519be00000","value":"0"},{"target":"0xabe146cf570fd27ddd985895ce9b138a7110cce8","signature":"setFeed(address,address,uint8)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000003b3fb9c57858ef816833dc91565efcd85d96f6340000000000000000000000006e9122de3240c51f58103338748864eafc30e74f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012","value":"0"},{"target":"0x4df2eaa1658a220fdb415b9966a9ae7c3d16e240","signature":"setMarket(address,address,address,bool)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2000000000000000000000000865377367054516e17014ccded1e7d814edc9ce40000000000000000000000004809fe7d314c2ae5b2eb7fa19c1b166434d291410000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x4809fe7d314c2ae5b2eb7fa19c1b166434d29141","signature":"setMarket(address,address,address)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db20000000000000000000000003b3fb9c57858ef816833dc91565efcd85d96f634000000000000000000000000b7e51d15161c49c823f3951d579ded61cd27272b","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x759a159d78342340ebacffb027c05910c093f430","support":true,"votes":100703.24474914269},{"id":2,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":22307.816364200047}]},{"id":297,"proposalNum":326,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","etaTimestamp":1749969983000,"startTimestamp":1749588311000,"endTimestamp":1749788138165,"startBlock":22676639,"endBlock":22693919,"forVotes":129475.68028665335,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1749970067000,"title":"Adjust sDOLA Auction and DSA Parameters","description":"# Adjust sDOLA Auction and DSA Parameters\\n\\nForum Post: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/adjust-sdola-auction-and-dsa-parameters-2/575\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal refines the economic parameters that govern the DOLA Savings Account (DSA) and the sDOLA–DBR XY-K auction.

A deeper auction tightens the spread between the auction sell price and the DBR market price, reducing gas cost barriers and increasing sDOLA APY.\\n\\nRecommended Actions:\\n\\n1. Increase dbrReserve to ~1.2M DBR:\\n\\n- Gradually allocate 800K DBR into the sDOLA contract over 7 days post-proposal approval, via the TWG. This staggered approach aligns with the K value ramp-up, ensuring arbitrage profitability remains stable.\\n\\n2. Increase K Value:\\n\\n- Current: 1.26E+46\\n\\n- Proposed: 1.12E+47\\n\\n- Rationale: Deepening the auction balances sDOLA APY stability while ensuring the open market remains the primary venue for DBR trading.

The trade-off is a temporary, controlled squeeze on DAO profit today for a larger, more sustainable revenue base tomorrow.\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn Chain Actions\\n\\nsetMaxYearlyRewardBudget to 60m\\nsetTargetK to 1.12E+47","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0xe5f24791e273cb96a1f8e5b67bc2397f0ad9b8b4","signature":"setMaxYearlyRewardBudget(uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000031a17e847807b1bc000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0xb45ad160634c528cc3d2926d9807104fa3157305","signature":"setTargetK(uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000139e40f23af10aa34c3dc604df26000000000000","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x58a15c1b4821a5bc2529c3b93538daea9ca8e7f4","support":true,"votes":3141.7159939803773},{"id":2,"voter":"0x759a159d78342340ebacffb027c05910c093f430","support":true,"votes":100503.24474914269},{"id":3,"voter":"0x94a8216bc7a0390597c0aaf8500d97f4d7663ce5","support":true,"votes":3828.9131004642013},{"id":4,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":22001.806443066092}]},{"id":298,"proposalNum":327,"era":"mills","proposer":"0xec092c15e8d5a48a77cde36827f8e228ce39471a","etaTimestamp":1750045115000,"startTimestamp":1749663491000,"endTimestamp":1749863306509,"startBlock":22682860,"endBlock":22700140,"forVotes":122505.05119220878,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1750045427000,"title":"Update the FiRM Borrow Controller To Linear Borrow Limit Replenishments [1/2]","description":"# Update the FiRM Borrow Controller\\n\\nForum Post: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/update-the-firm-borrow-controller/572\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal aims to update the borrow controller for all active markets on FiRM to implement an improved method of handling the daily borrow limit.

Like its predecessor (the successfully onboarded PT-sUSDe-31JUL25), PT-sUSDe-24SEP25 is a Principal Token representing the right to receive 1 USDe upon maturity—this time on September 24, 2025.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nPendle Finance is a yield-trading platform that tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two components:\\n\\n* Principal Tokens (PTs), redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity;\\n* Yield Tokens (YTs), which accrue the asset’s yield until expiry.\\n\\nAfter a successful integration of PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 on FiRM in late 2024, demand for PT-based strategies has proven to be strong. This new PT, PT-sUSDe-24SEP25, extends the maturity date and aims to offer continued opportunities for fixed-income and carry-trade strategies, leveraging FiRM’s fixed-rate borrowing.\\n\\n## Price Feed\\n\\nSimilarly to the previously onboarded PT-sUSDe-31JUL25 market, we intend to use a discount to NAV price feed. This feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears. Only two main parameters—discount rate and time (block #) of maturity—must be configured. Importantly, by setting a conservative discount rate, the protocol intentionally underprices the PT relative to potential market optimism, which is safer from a protocol risk perspective.\\n\\n## Business Case\\n\\nThe 31 July PT demonstrated strong initial borrower interest.

Like its predecessor (the successfully onboarded PT-sUSDe-31JUL25), PT-sUSDe-24SEP25 is a Principal Token representing the right to receive 1 USDe upon maturity—this time on September 24, 2025.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nPendle Finance is a yield-trading platform that tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two components:\\n\\nPrincipal Tokens (PTs), redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity;\\nYield Tokens (YTs), which accrue the asset’s yield until expiry.\\n\\nAfter a successful integration of PT-sUSDe-27MAR2025 on FiRM in late 2024, demand for PT-based strategies has proven to be strong. This new PT, PT-sUSDe-24SEP25, extends the maturity date and aims to offer continued opportunities for fixed-income and carry-trade strategies, leveraging FiRM’s fixed-rate borrowing.\\n\\nPrice Feed\\n\\nSimilarly to the previously onboarded PT-sUSDe-31JUL25 market, we intend to use a discount to NAV price feed. This feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears. Only two main parameters—discount rate and time (block #) of maturity—must be configured. Importantly, by setting a conservative discount rate, the protocol intentionally underprices the PT relative to potential market optimism, which is safer from a protocol risk perspective.\\n\\nBusiness Case\\n\\nThe 31 July PT demonstrated strong initial borrower interest. FiRM was on track to originate eight-figure debt volumes, only to see that momentum diverted when Aave pre-emptively raised its caps from $800 million to $1.3 billion. By the time our July market cleared governance, prospective borrowers had already migrated their positions to Aave’s more attractive rate environment.\\n\\nWith the PT-sUSDe-24SEP25, we have a clear window to regain first-mover advantage:\\n\\nEarly Listing**: Propose and onboard the September PT before competing platforms such as AAVE finalize their cap increases, locking in early movers at compelling rates.\\nSeamless Rollover**: Offering a continuous pathway from the 31 July PT into the September PT reassures potential borrowers on the July PT of uninterrupted exposure, reducing churn and building protocol stickiness. With rates on competitors such as AAVE and Morpho raising, it could soon be very attractive for users to migrate to FiRM to lock in cheaper rates.\\nDebt Growth**: Early origination not only recaptures deferred volume from July’s market but also secures incremental debt against a high-demand tenor.\\n\\nTherefore, onboarding the September PT ahead of peers is critical to reasserting FiRM’s position in the fixed-term lending landscape, maximizing debt supply, and strengthening borrower confidence in rollover availability.\\n\\nRisk Assessment\\n\\nPlease see the Risk Assessment carried out by the RWG for PT-sUSDe-24SEP25 Collateral on FiRM here.\\n\\nWith the following parameter recommendation:\\n\\n|Parameter|Recommended Value|\\n| --- | --- |\\n|Supply Ceiling|50,000,000 DOLA|\\n|Daily Borrow Limit|2,000,000 DOLA|\\n|Collateral Factor|91.5%|\\n|Liquidation Factor|100%|\\n|Liquidation Incentive|5%|\\n|Minimum Debt Amount|3,000 DOLA|\\n|Oracle|Discount to NAV, r =

This adjustment is designed to have no immediate impact on existing positions.\\n\\nThe 100% liquidation factor improves liquidator profitability margins and provides increased flexibility to prevent bad debt accumulation during sudden price drops and high gas costs, which is crucial for assets with deteriorated liquidity conditions and gas intensive liquidation mechanics.\\n\\nIn doing so, we follow established methodology used in previous successful parameter adjustments, ensuring consistency with FiRM\'s proven risk management framework.\\n\\nOn-Chain Actions\\n\\nSet Liquidation Factor for FiRMs cvxCRV market to 100%\\nSet Liquidation Factor for FiRMs st-yCRV market to 100%","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0x3474ad0e3a9775c9f68b415a7a9880b0cab9397a","signature":"setLiquidationFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002710","value":"0"},{"target":"0x27b6c301fd441f3345d61b7a4245e1f823c3f9c4","signature":"setLiquidationFactorBps(uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002710","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x58a15c1b4821a5bc2529c3b93538daea9ca8e7f4","support":true,"votes":3170.5313975903773},{"id":2,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":30497.05125038163},{"id":3,"voter":"0xd9b04f8edff8a2b5e1c55bb24bf7236c3df9d562","support":true,"votes":173.5277534830016}]},{"id":305,"proposalNum":334,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x3fcb35a1cbfb6007f9bc638d388958bc4550cb28","etaTimestamp":1753439243000,"startTimestamp":1753057499000,"endTimestamp":1753259946558,"startBlock":22963969,"endBlock":22981249,"forVotes":148638.8066809268,"againstVotes":100303.24474914269,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1753439327000,"title":"DOLA bad debt elimination proposal","description":"Forum post link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/dola-bad-debt-elimination-proposal/581\\n\\n# Summary\\n\\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the remaining ~$6M of DOLA bad debt through two funding sources: (1) Some of DeFi’s most prominent investors have committed to immediately repay $2.6M of DOLA bad debt in exchange for a vested INV swap provided by the treasury.

Like the PT-sUSDe markets, this is a Principal Token representing the right to receive **1 USDe** upon maturity—this time on **September 25, 2025**.\\n\\n## Background\\nPendle Finance is a yield-trading platform that tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two components:  \\n- **Principal Tokens (PTs)**: redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity.  \\n- **Yield Tokens (YTs)**: accrue the asset’s yield until expiry.  \\n\\n## Price Feed\\nSimilarly to the previously onboarded PT-sUSDe markets, we intend to use a **discount to NAV price feed**. This feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears.

Like the PT-sUSDe markets, this is a Principal Token representing the right to receive 1 USDe upon maturity—this time on September 25, 2025.\\n\\nBackground\\nPendle Finance is a yield-trading platform that tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two components:  \\nPrincipal Tokens (PTs)**: redeemable for the underlying asset at maturity.  \\nYield Tokens (YTs)**: accrue the asset’s yield until expiry.  \\n\\nPrice Feed\\nSimilarly to the previously onboarded PT-sUSDe markets, we intend to use a discount to NAV price feed. This feed accounts for the zero-coupon nature of the PT by applying a fixed discount rate to par value that exponentially converges to $1 as maturity nears. Only two main parameters—discount rate and time (block #) of maturity—must be configured.  \\n\\nImportantly, by setting a conservative discount rate, the protocol intentionally underprices the PT relative to potential market optimism, which is safer from a protocol risk perspective.\\n\\nBusiness Case\\nMultiple users, as well as the Ethena team, have requested the PT-USDe market for integration on FiRM. The fixed yield has been very high, near 15%, given the robust market demand for buying the YTs. With current FiRM rates, this presents a very attractive opportunity for users to leverage a high fixed yield spread on FiRM.\\n\\nMarket Parameters\\nGiven that the risk profile of the market is very similar to the previously onboarded PT-sUSDe-24SEP25 market, identical risk parameters are being proposed for this market.\\n\\n| Parameter            | Recommended Value

Now over a week past maturity, this market no longer serves a viable purpose for new borrowing. Principal tokens lose their yield-bearing properties at expiry and convert to their underlying asset, making continued support operationally inefficient. This deprecation follows standard lifecycle management for expiring assets, consistent with our handling of the previously expired PT-sUSDe-27MAR25 and PT-sUSDe-29MAY25 markets.\\n\\n### **deUSD-DOLA LP & yv-deUSD-DOLA LP**\\n\\nThe deUSD-DOLA LP markets were paused on June 20, 2025, following growing concerns about the Elixir protocol\'s risk profile. After 2 months of observation, the RWG determined that resuming these markets was not in the best interest of the DAO, and communicated such to the Elixir team. deUSD remains in an early development phase with evolving governance structures, planned technical transitions requiring new audits and expanding multichain strategies that continuously alter the risk assessment for the asset at a time when, we believe, Inverse Finance should prioritize protocols with more immutable underlying infrastructure. The resource allocation required to monitor Elixir through its experimental development phase does not justify the potential market opportunity.\\n\\n## **On-Chain Actions**\\n\\nFor each market listed:\\n\\n* **PT-sUSDe-31JUL25:** pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\n* **deUSD-DOLA:** setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\n* **yv-deUSD-DOLA:** setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA","descriptionAsText":"Forum Link: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/sunset-pt-susde-31jul25-and-deusd-dola-lp-markets/592\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis proposal recommends formally sunsetting three FiRM markets by setting their market ceilings to zero and pausing new borrows where applicable.

From a security perspective, deprecating these markets narrows the protocol\'s exposure to tail risks and allows the RWG to focus resources on higher-impact opportunities.\\n\\nBy formally winding down these markets, we reinforce our commitment to good protocol hygiene and signal to external partners and users that FiRM collateral is thoughtfully curated and regularly maintained.\\n\\nBackground & Rationale\\n\\nPT-sUSDe-31JUL25\\n\\nThe PT-sUSDe-31JUL25 market holds a Pendle Finance principal token that expires on July 31, 2025. Now over a week past maturity, this market no longer serves a viable purpose for new borrowing. Principal tokens lose their yield-bearing properties at expiry and convert to their underlying asset, making continued support operationally inefficient. This deprecation follows standard lifecycle management for expiring assets, consistent with our handling of the previously expired PT-sUSDe-27MAR25 and PT-sUSDe-29MAY25 markets.\\n\\ndeUSD-DOLA LP & yv-deUSD-DOLA LP\\n\\nThe deUSD-DOLA LP markets were paused on June 20, 2025, following growing concerns about the Elixir protocol\'s risk profile. After 2 months of observation, the RWG determined that resuming these markets was not in the best interest of the DAO, and communicated such to the Elixir team. deUSD remains in an early development phase with evolving governance structures, planned technical transitions requiring new audits and expanding multichain strategies that continuously alter the risk assessment for the asset at a time when, we believe, Inverse Finance should prioritize protocols with more immutable underlying infrastructure. The resource allocation required to monitor Elixir through its experimental development phase does not justify the potential market opportunity.\\n\\nOn-Chain Actions\\n\\nFor each market listed:\\n\\nPT-sUSDe-31JUL25:** pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\ndeUSD-DOLA:** setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\nyv-deUSD-DOLA:** setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0xf85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db2","signature":"pauseBorrows(bool)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000004f5ea72d932f554f08e97cb78dd25f8aae43c08e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000b907dcc926b5991a149d04cb7c0a4a25dc2d8f9a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000f85ed61dfd00bcd89ae0a6085b062a261e222db20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x0e0f6cc63cce00563a85435d17bb0bb048ddc215","support":true,"votes":213.3809116220469},{"id":2,"voter":"0x412c8dc906e72736a015bd49b4e86971422e6c2c","support":true,"votes":207.09344347852883},{"id":3,"voter":"0x58a15c1b4821a5bc2529c3b93538daea9ca8e7f4","support":true,"votes":3180.073418350378},{"id":4,"voter":"0x759a159d78342340ebacffb027c05910c093f430","support":true,"votes":100053.24474914269},{"id":5,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":29773.489000582103},{"id":6,"voter":"0xe5dbf334d03a8474b4617eed1d2518c5c776b225","support":true,"votes":170}]},{"id":311,"proposalNum":340,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x2723723fdd3db8ba2d6f0e1b333e90a7e60a0411","etaTimestamp":1756689611000,"startTimestamp":1756308203000,"endTimestamp":1756514599273,"startBlock":23233327,"endBlock":23250607,"forVotes":130363.97543620582,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1756689815000,"title":"Activate the DOLA Peg Stability Module","description":"Forum: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/activate-the-dola-peg-stability-module/596\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThis proposal activates Inverse Finance’s new Peg Stability Module (PSM) for USDS, replacing the deprecated Stabilizer.

The suggested rate is ~2.5% APR, but governance may set a different constant depending on risk preference.\\n\\nanDOLA: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7Fcb7DAC61eE35b3D4a51117A7c58D53f0a8a670\\nconstantIRM: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd3d6ddb266dc9db2b71b095840c3b98e17e6f1a7\\nborrowRatePerBlock: 9512937595\\n\\nOn-Chain Action\\n\\nanDOLA._setInterestRateModel 0xd3D6ddB266dC9db2B71B095840c3B98e17e6F1A7\\nWithdraw all DOLA Market reserves\\nRepayBorrowBehalf the DOLA borrow balance of 0xeA0c959BBb7476DDD6cD4204bDee82b790AA1562","status":"Executed","functions":[{"target":"0x7fcb7dac61ee35b3d4a51117a7c58d53f0a8a670","signature":"_setInterestRateModel(address)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000d3d6ddb266dc9db2b71b095840c3b98e17e6f1a7","value":"0"},{"target":"0x7fcb7dac61ee35b3d4a51117a7c58d53f0a8a670","signature":"_reduceReserves(uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001195d8f4f5f9f26f56ab","value":"0"},{"target":"0x865377367054516e17014ccded1e7d814edc9ce4","signature":"approve(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000007fcb7dac61ee35b3d4a51117a7c58d53f0a8a670000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001195d8f4f5f9f26f56ab","value":"0"},{"target":"0x7fcb7dac61ee35b3d4a51117a7c58d53f0a8a670","signature":"repayBorrowBehalf(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000ea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001195d8f4f5f9f26f56ab","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","support":true,"votes":29773.489000582103}]},{"id":314,"proposalNum":343,"era":"mills","proposer":"0x962228a90eac69238c7d1f216d80037e61ea9255","etaTimestamp":1757837519000,"startTimestamp":1757455523000,"endTimestamp":1757663571744,"startBlock":23328417,"endBlock":23345697,"forVotes":133583.8729488383,"againstVotes":0,"canceled":false,"executed":true,"executionTimestamp":1757837687000,"title":"Onboard PT-USDe-27NOV25 Market to FiRM","description":"# Add PT-USDe-27NOV25 Market to FiRM\\n\\nForum Post: https://forum.inverse.finance/t/onboard-pt-usde-27nov25-to-firm/599\\n\\n## Summary\\nThis proposal seeks to integrate the PT-USDe-27NOV25 token from Pendle as a collateral asset on FiRM, Inverse Finance’s fixed-rate lending protocol.

The formation documents will ensure that the foundation is held accountable to DAO holders by law and can be directly controlled by on-chain votes. Additionally, the foundation will not gain access to any existing DAO treasury assets unless deemed necessary by an on-chain vote. The main purpose of the IFF is to replace some of the DAO working group multisigs, acting as the DAO’s primary executive arm. This transition will be phased over future proposals. This proposal only requests funding to create the foundation and does not grant the foundation any privileges or assets.\\n\\n# Rationale\\n\\nThe proposed foundation will provide two main benefits to the DAO:\\n\\n1. Consolidate DAO contributors’ efforts into one coordinated, accountable and DAO-controlled entity instead of separate working groups\\n2. Unlock access to off-chain benefits such as banking, contractual agreements with partners, contributor employment contracts, physical presence, and ownership of off-chain assets such as intellectual property, equity, hosting and domain names.\\n\\nThe legal setup of the foundation will grant DAO voters the highest authority to impose rules, changes and restrictions on foundation directors and employees by a simple on-chain vote. This setup will allow the DAO to delegate on-chain privileges and assets or provide a discretionary budget while ensuring that funds are used in the best interests of the DAO.\\n\\nAt any time and at the DAO’s discretion, the DAO holders may vote to replace directors and employees, require transparency disclosures, liquidate foundation assets and/or return funds to the DAO’s treasury address.\\n\\n# Vision\\n\\nAs the main executive arm of the DAO, the foundation is expected to request a limited discretionary budget funded by the DAO treasury to cover opex spending. The foundation will replace, and take over the operations of, all existing working groups except for the Treasury Working Group. All expenses will be spent through the foundation except for treasury management spending and operations which will remain the responsibility of the Treasury Working Group.\\n\\nDOLA payroll for existing contributors will continue to be streamed directly from the DAO treasury using the existing Payroll contract. Contributors who choose to become employees or contractors of the foundation will be removed from the Payroll contract and added to the foundation’s budget based on their request. Future contributors are expected to become employees or contractors of the foundation or its subsidiaries or service providers.\\n\\nThe foundation will use its discretionary budget to cover expenses such as server infrastructure costs, security audits, product marketing and advertising, event management, legal counsel, talent and other expenses. This budget will allow the DAO contributors to move swiftly without requiring a governance proposal for every new spending item. The foundation will provide recurring cash flow statements to be reviewed by the DAO in order to ensure transparency.\\n\\nSubject to DAO approval, the foundation will request a continuously streamed budget from the DAO treasury rather than a lump sum amount. DAO voters will retain the power to cut funding to the foundation at any time without its permission by simply suspending the budget streaming contract.\\n\\n# Incorporation process\\n\\n## Legal Counsel\\n\\nAfter exploring multiple options, we intend to retain the Carey Olsen law firm as legal counsel in order to pursue the creation of the foundation. This firm was recommended by some of our close partners who have hired them in the past.

The formation documents will ensure that the foundation is held accountable to DAO holders by law and can be directly controlled by on-chain votes. Additionally, the foundation will not gain access to any existing DAO treasury assets unless deemed necessary by an on-chain vote. The main purpose of the IFF is to replace some of the DAO working group multisigs, acting as the DAO’s primary executive arm. This transition will be phased over future proposals. This proposal only requests funding to create the foundation and does not grant the foundation any privileges or assets.\\n\\nRationale\\n\\nThe proposed foundation will provide two main benefits to the DAO:\\n\\nConsolidate DAO contributors’ efforts into one coordinated, accountable and DAO-controlled entity instead of separate working groups\\nUnlock access to off-chain benefits such as banking, contractual agreements with partners, contributor employment contracts, physical presence, and ownership of off-chain assets such as intellectual property, equity, hosting and domain names.\\n\\nThe legal setup of the foundation will grant DAO voters the highest authority to impose rules, changes and restrictions on foundation directors and employees by a simple on-chain vote. This setup will allow the DAO to delegate on-chain privileges and assets or provide a discretionary budget while ensuring that funds are used in the best interests of the DAO.\\n\\nAt any time and at the DAO’s discretion, the DAO holders may vote to replace directors and employees, require transparency disclosures, liquidate foundation assets and/or return funds to the DAO’s treasury address.\\n\\nVision\\n\\nAs the main executive arm of the DAO, the foundation is expected to request a limited discretionary budget funded by the DAO treasury to cover opex spending. The foundation will replace, and take over the operations of, all existing working groups except for the Treasury Working Group. All expenses will be spent through the foundation except for treasury management spending and operations which will remain the responsibility of the Treasury Working Group.\\n\\nDOLA payroll for existing contributors will continue to be streamed directly from the DAO treasury using the existing Payroll contract. Contributors who choose to become employees or contractors of the foundation will be removed from the Payroll contract and added to the foundation’s budget based on their request. Future contributors are expected to become employees or contractors of the foundation or its subsidiaries or service providers.\\n\\nThe foundation will use its discretionary budget to cover expenses such as server infrastructure costs, security audits, product marketing and advertising, event management, legal counsel, talent and other expenses. This budget will allow the DAO contributors to move swiftly without requiring a governance proposal for every new spending item. The foundation will provide recurring cash flow statements to be reviewed by the DAO in order to ensure transparency.\\n\\nSubject to DAO approval, the foundation will request a continuously streamed budget from the DAO treasury rather than a lump sum amount. DAO voters will retain the power to cut funding to the foundation at any time without its permission by simply suspending the budget streaming contract.\\n\\nIncorporation process\\n\\nLegal Counsel\\n\\nAfter exploring multiple options, we intend to retain the Carey Olsen law firm as legal counsel in order to pursue the creation of the foundation. This firm was recommended by some of our close partners who have hired them in the past. Carey Olsen is also retained by some of DeFi’s largest players and has extensive experience in setting up similar structures.\\n\\nAfter the incorporation is complete, we expect Carey Olsen to also act as legal counsel for the foundation. However, it is possible to engage with other law firms as well, for example, for matters that relate to jurisdictions or legal areas outside of Carey Olsen’s experience.\\n\\nJurisdiction\\n\\nCarey Olsen has recommended the Cayman Islands as the host jurisdiction for the IFF thanks to the great flexibility of its foundation structures.

The markets targeted for deprecation include: scrvUSD-sDOLA, yv-scrvUSD-sDOLA, scrvUSD-DOLA, and yv-scrvUSD-DOLA. These actions are part of ongoing operational cleanup initiatives to streamline FiRM’s collateral roster, reduce unnecessary risk exposure, and improve protocol efficiency.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nAs FiRM matures, periodic reviews of its supported collateral markets are essential to maintaining a healthy, efficient lending protocol. The recent passing of Curve DAO governance proposal #1206, which authorized a credit line of up to 60M crvUSD to bootstrap the Yield Basis protocol, represents a fundamental restructuring that warrants immediate risk reassessment.\\n\\nSunsetting these markets serves multiple objectives. It removes operational overhead from the RWG, reduces the monitoring burden for tracking new protocol dependencies, and minimizes governance surface area around parameters that no longer align with our risk tolerance. From a security perspective, deprecating these markets narrows the protocol’s exposure to tail risks during Yield Basis’s initial operational phase and allows the RWG to focus resources on higher-impact opportunities.\\n\\n### Background & Rationale\\n\\nThe crvUSD LP markets require reassessment following Curve DAO’s approval of a 60M crvUSD pre-mint (~55% of current supply) to bootstrap Yield Basis, a newly deployed leveraged yield farming protocol. Since the initial 60M crvUSD authorization, a new Curve governance proposal has been published seeking to increase crvUSD caps for Yield Basis pools to 300M crvUSD—a figure representing over 2x current total crvUSD supply. This signals the intention for continued aggressive expansion of crvUSD backing into Yield Basis. This structural change introduces new dependencies where crvUSD stability relies on Yield Basis performance, which itself depends on Curve pool mechanics and BTC price action. The magnitude of this change triggers our FiRM Collateral Screening Framework requirement for a hard minimum of 6 months operational history before accepting modified collateral structures.\\n\\nThe new backing mechanism moves crvUSD away from its established infrastructure. While Yield Basis has undergone comprehensive security review, the protocol has zero operational history, and the resource allocation required to monitor this experimental phase does not justify the remaining market opportunity.

The markets targeted for deprecation include: scrvUSD-sDOLA, yv-scrvUSD-sDOLA, scrvUSD-DOLA, and yv-scrvUSD-DOLA. These actions are part of ongoing operational cleanup initiatives to streamline FiRM’s collateral roster, reduce unnecessary risk exposure, and improve protocol efficiency.\\n\\nMotivation\\n\\nAs FiRM matures, periodic reviews of its supported collateral markets are essential to maintaining a healthy, efficient lending protocol. The recent passing of Curve DAO governance proposal #1206, which authorized a credit line of up to 60M crvUSD to bootstrap the Yield Basis protocol, represents a fundamental restructuring that warrants immediate risk reassessment.\\n\\nSunsetting these markets serves multiple objectives. It removes operational overhead from the RWG, reduces the monitoring burden for tracking new protocol dependencies, and minimizes governance surface area around parameters that no longer align with our risk tolerance. From a security perspective, deprecating these markets narrows the protocol’s exposure to tail risks during Yield Basis’s initial operational phase and allows the RWG to focus resources on higher-impact opportunities.\\n\\nBackground & Rationale\\n\\nThe crvUSD LP markets require reassessment following Curve DAO’s approval of a 60M crvUSD pre-mint (~55% of current supply) to bootstrap Yield Basis, a newly deployed leveraged yield farming protocol. Since the initial 60M crvUSD authorization, a new Curve governance proposal has been published seeking to increase crvUSD caps for Yield Basis pools to 300M crvUSD—a figure representing over 2x current total crvUSD supply. This signals the intention for continued aggressive expansion of crvUSD backing into Yield Basis. This structural change introduces new dependencies where crvUSD stability relies on Yield Basis performance, which itself depends on Curve pool mechanics and BTC price action. The magnitude of this change triggers our FiRM Collateral Screening Framework requirement for a hard minimum of 6 months operational history before accepting modified collateral structures.\\n\\nThe new backing mechanism moves crvUSD away from its established infrastructure. While Yield Basis has undergone comprehensive security review, the protocol has zero operational history, and the resource allocation required to monitor this experimental phase does not justify the remaining market opportunity. This decision reflects adherence to our collateral screening framework rather than any assessment of Yield Basis’s security or audit quality.\\n\\nThe RWG is entering a formal 6-month observation period to assess Yield Basis operational performance through our weekly Risk Observer Checklist. Reassessment criteria for potential future reintroduction include successful operational history with no critical incidents, demonstrated stability under market stress, and material reduction in monitoring overhead requirements aligned with our collateral screening standards.\\n\\nOn-Chain Actions\\n\\nFor each market listed:\\n\\nscrvUSD-sDOLA: pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\nyv-scrvUSD-sDOLA: pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\nscrvUSD-DOLA: pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA\\n\\nyv-scrvUSD-DOLA: pauseBorrows = true, setMarketCeiling = 0 DOLA","status":"Defeated","functions":[{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000002fed508aac87c0e6f0b647fe83164a7aa6eb2fc90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x00000000000000000000000063d27fc9d463ed727676367d3f818999962737e80000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000005bb8f6aacff2971b42f9fe6945d24726a2541cf20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2b34548b865ad66a2b046cb82e59ee43f75b90fd","signature":"changeMarketCeiling(address,uint256)","callData":"0x000000000000000000000000b8bc1e9c0a2d445bc39d2a745f47619e954dd5650000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","value":"0"},{"target":"0x2fed508aac87c0e6f0b647fe83164a7aa6eb2fc9","signature":"pauseBorrows(bool)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","value":"0"},{"target":"0x63d27fc9d463ed727676367d3f818999962737e8","signature":"pauseBorrows(bool)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","value":"0"},{"target":"0x5bb8f6aacff2971b42f9fe6945d24726a2541cf2","signature":"pauseBorrows(bool)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","value":"0"},{"target":"0xb8bc1e9c0a2d445bc39d2a745f47619e954dd565","signature":"pauseBorrows(bool)","callData":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","value":"0"}],"voters":[{"id":1,"voter":"0x95a0dae2c7c5a6324f5d6e6d276cd0cddb9542de","support":true,"votes":772.4121242797617}]}],"success":true}
